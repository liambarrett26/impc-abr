# IMPC ABR

Further information will be provided as the project develops. Codebase and results are work in progress.

## Background

The International Mouse Phenotyping Consortium (IMPC) ABR dataset provides a wealth of information about hearing phenotypes in knockout mice. In the original analysis (Bowl et al., 2017), traditional statistical methods were used to identify hearing loss genes by comparing ABR thresholds at individual frequencies between wild-type and knockout mice. While successful in identifying 67 hearing loss genes, this approach considers each frequency measurement in isolation.

## Proposed Novel Approach

We propose treating each mouse's ABR profile as a unified multivariate observation rather than as separate measurements. This approach is analogous to how we visually interpret audiograms - we look at the overall shape and pattern, not just individual points.
