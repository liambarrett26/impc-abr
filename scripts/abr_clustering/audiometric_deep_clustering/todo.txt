# TODO: ContrastiveVAE-DEC Next Steps

## Immediate Priority

### 1. Full-Scale Training Run
- [ ] Execute complete 3-stage pipeline with full epoch counts
- [ ] Monitor training progress and loss convergence
- [ ] Validate that clustering emerges properly with adequate training
- [ ] Expected duration: 4-6 hours for full training
- [ ] Command: `python scripts/train.py --experiment-name "full_scale_training"`

### 2. Comprehensive Evaluation
- [ ] Run full evaluation suite on trained model
- [ ] Generate complete metrics (clustering quality, reconstruction, etc.)
- [ ] Perform phenotype analysis and gene enrichment (if working)
- [ ] Create publication-ready visualizations
- [ ] Analyze biological significance of discovered clusters

### 3. Results Analysis
- [ ] Review cluster quality metrics (silhouette score, ARI, etc.)
- [ ] Validate cluster interpretability and biological relevance
- [ ] Compare with baseline clustering methods
- [ ] Document key findings and insights

## Technical Improvements (Lower Priority)

### 4. Bug Fixes
- [ ] Fix phenotype analysis indexing bug (frequency mapping issue)
- [ ] Resolve interactive visualization null handling in comprehensive reports
- [ ] Improve error handling for edge cases

### 5. Performance Optimization
- [ ] Profile training performance and identify bottlenecks
- [ ] Optimize data loading pipeline if needed
- [ ] Consider mixed precision training improvements
- [ ] Evaluate memory usage patterns

### 6. Hyperparameter Tuning
- [ ] Experiment with different cluster counts (8, 10, 12, 15)
- [ ] Test alternative loss weight combinations
- [ ] Validate learning rate schedules
- [ ] Explore latent dimension sensitivity

## Documentation & Deployment

### 7. Results Documentation
- [ ] Create comprehensive results summary
- [ ] Document cluster characteristics and biological interpretations
- [ ] Prepare visualization gallery
- [ ] Write methodology summary

### 8. Code Quality
- [ ] Add any missing unit tests for edge cases
- [ ] Update documentation strings if needed
- [ ] Code cleanup and optimization
- [ ] Prepare for potential publication/sharing

## Research Extensions (Future)

### 9. Model Enhancements
- [ ] Experiment with alternative attention mechanisms
- [ ] Test different contrastive learning strategies
- [ ] Explore hierarchical clustering approaches
- [ ] Consider multi-modal extensions

### 10. Biological Validation
- [ ] Collaborate with domain experts for cluster interpretation
- [ ] Validate against known hearing loss gene databases
- [ ] Compare with clinical hearing loss classifications
- [ ] Explore therapeutic implications
